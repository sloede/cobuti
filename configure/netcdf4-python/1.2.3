# First modify setup.cfg and set the following:
# use_ncconfig = False
# netCDF4_incdir = /pds/opt/netcdf/include
# netCDF4_libdir = /pds/opt/netcdf/lib64
# HDF5_incdir = /pds/opt/hdf5/include
# HDF5_libdir = /pds/opt/hdf5/lib64

# Alternatively, you can also use python
CPPFLAGS="-I/pds/opt/openmpi/include" \
LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath,/pds/opt/openmpi/lib64" \
python3 setup.py build

python3 setup.py install --prefix=/pds/opt/netcdf4-python-1.2.3
